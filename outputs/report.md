# ðŸ“Š Scrollmark Trend Analysis Report: @treehut Instagram Engagement

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of 17,513 Instagram comments from @treehut (March-April 2025) reveals powerful insights for social media strategy optimization. Using advanced NLP techniques including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and temporal analysis, we identified five critical engagement drivers: **giveaway campaigns generate 2,000-5,000+ comments per post**, **scent-focused content drives 134+ organic mentions**, **product demand signals through "need" keyword (326 mentions)**, **viral timing opportunities (March 21st generated 3,471 comments - 6.5x average)**, and **massive conversion potential in 80.7% neutral sentiment audience**.

The analysis employed Python-based data science tools (pandas, NLTK, scikit-learn) to process comments through sentiment analysis (VADER + TextBlob), TF-IDF keyword extraction, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling. Key findings include giveaway posts dominating engagement (top 3 posts = 13,000+ comments), strong purchase intent signals ("need", "want", "please" keywords), and optimal posting windows during Monday evenings and Friday afternoons. These insights provide immediate actionable strategies for increasing organic reach, improving sentiment conversion, and optimizing content timing for maximum ROI.

## ðŸš€ Instructions for Running & Extending

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/NikhilSoni15/scrollmark_test.git
cd scrollmark_test

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly nltk textblob scikit-learn wordcloud tqdm

# 3. Run analysis
jupyter notebook notebooks/trend_analysis.ipynb
```

### Running the Analysis
1. **Data Preparation**: Place your `engagements.csv` in the root directory
2. **Environment Setup**: Execute cells 1-4 to import libraries and download NLTK data
3. **Core Analysis**: Run cells 5-15 for data processing and feature engineering
4. **Visualizations**: Execute cells 16-20 to generate all charts and insights

### Extending the Work

#### Adding New Data Sources
```python
# Modify cell 5 to include additional CSV files:
df_additional = pd.read_csv('new_engagements.csv')
df_combined = pd.concat([df, df_additional], ignore_index=True)
```

#### Custom Sentiment Analysis
```python
# Add industry-specific sentiment lexicon:
custom_lexicon = {'treehut': 0.5, 'skincare': 0.3, 'routine': 0.2}
# Integrate with existing VADER scores in cell 10
```

#### Advanced Topic Modeling
```python
# Increase topic granularity:
n_topics = 10  # Change from 5 to 10 in cell 13
# Add topic coherence evaluation
from gensim.models.coherencemodel import CoherenceModel
```

#### Real-time Monitoring Dashboard
```python
# Integration points for live data:
# - Replace CSV loading with API calls
# - Add scheduled analysis runs
# - Implement alert system for engagement spikes
```

### Customization Options
- **Time Periods**: Modify date filters in cell 7 for different analysis windows

### Troubleshooting
- **NLTK Data Issues**: Run `nltk.download('all')` if sentiment analysis fails
- **Memory Constraints**: Process data in chunks for datasets >50k comments
- **Visualization Errors**: Ensure matplotlib backend supports display: `%matplotlib inline`
